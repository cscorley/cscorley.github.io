I am a software engineer based in Chattanooga, TN.  Currently, I work primarily
with Ruby on Rails and TypeScript.  Previously, I have worked extensively with
.NET (C#), Python, and Elasticsearch.

I also have a Ph.D. from the [Department of Computer Science][] at the
[University of Alabama][].  My research interests are in software engineering
and maintenance, specifically applications of topic modeling to automation of
software maintenance tasks.  Check out [my dissertation][].
