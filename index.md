I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Computer Science][] at the
[University of Alabama][]. My research interests are in software engineering
and maintenance, specifically applications of topic modeling to automation of
software maintenance tasks. I am part of the [Software Engineering Research
Group][] and a former [GAANN][] fellow. I am currently advised by [Dr. Nicholas
A. Kraft][]. I am grateful to have [Dr. Jeffrey C. Carver][] as my committee
chair.

At the moment, I am a visiting researcher at [ABB Corporate Research][] in
Raleigh, NC.
