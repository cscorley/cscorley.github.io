I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Computer Science][] at the
[University of Alabama][]. My research interests are in software engineering and
maintenance, specifically applications of topic modeling to automation of
software maintenance tasks. I am part of the
[Software Engineering Research Group][] and a former [GAANN][] fellow. I am
currently advised by [Dr. Nicholas A. Kraft][]. I am grateful to have
[Dr. Jeffrey C. Carver][] as my committee chair.

I am also a practicing software engineer based in Chattanooga, TN.  Currently,
I work primarily with .NET (C#), Python, and Elasticsearch.
