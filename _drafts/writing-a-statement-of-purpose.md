Recently, I needed to write a [statement of purpose][wiki] oriented towards
teaching. I was applying to UA's [Graduate Certificate in College Teaching
program][cert]. Here is the [full statement][pdf] as I submitted it as PDF.

In this post, I want to talk about what I wrote about and why. Below is the
full text of the statement. Afterwards, I'll break down the process I went
through writing this. Then, I'll try to sum up what I did into a few tips.

### My statement

> "Chris, if you're hungry, just come by my office after class -- I have peanut
> butter and jelly sandwiches I could share with you." -- Dr. Muse

I declined, even though I hadn't eaten in two days. I was having financial
trouble, was considering dropping out, and came into class distraught. The
entire notion of sharing his lunch with me took me by surprise -- I had never
encountered a teacher that would do that sort of thing before. Dr. Muse taught
the Calculus 2 summer course I took after my first year at the University of
North Alabama. And to be honest, I'm not sure how I would have made it past the
first year without the faculty in the Mathematics & Computer Science
department. I'm certain I wouldn't have graduated.

I learned early on that I had an affinity for teaching. It began during
a course on assembly language in the last semester of my sophomore year.
Everyone in the course was nervous about the upcoming test, so I organized
a study group. I discovered that I was the only one in the group that had
a firm grasp on the study material, and I ended up playing teacher. Afterwards,
we met up to study in all our remaining courses. Being in that sort of learning
environment was fun and engaging. I ended up becoming a student tutor in
computer science for the University's Academic Resource Center for all levels
of courses.

Eventually, I made it to graduate school at the University of Alabama. Here, I
got to teach a real, live, actual course, which was an amazing experience. I
had fun doing everything from coming up with lecture material and all the way
down to the grading and holding office hours. There's something great about
watching and being part of a student transforming from not having confidence in
their skill to having such mastery that they begin helping their peers
understand material.

While I helped transform some students, I also know there are students that I
could not reach. I want to have a career in teaching at the college level and I
do not feel like these teaching experiences are enough. Hence, I am applying to
the program to get a Graduate Certificate in College Teaching. I believe a firm
grasp of theory, research, and practice related to teaching and learning in
higher education would help me get there. Thus far, my educational background
has solely been in computer science. Adding a grounding in education would not
only help me personally, but more importantly enable me to guide future
students towards success in their own lives and careers.

Most recently, I volunteered my summer at the Tuscaloosa Public Library for
their "Teen Zone: Tech Lab" program. The program is an outreach program that
gives any teen the chance to come by and play with technology they otherwise
wouldn't have access to, such as 3-D printing. I helped kids of all ages learn
to program and troubleshoot computers. One thing that struck me is that there
are a lot of brilliant children regularly participating, but did not believe
that they could make it to college. I thought, "man, this was *so* me," having
been through the same struggles when I was their age.

Although I am targeting collegiate teaching, I still have a desire for this
sort of outreach. I know that many people in this world need someone that will
help them realize their full potential. I would not be here if it weren't for
the professors, teachers, and colleagues I've had the privilege to learn from.
I am pursuing a teaching career, and I have peanut butter and jelly sandwiches
to share.
