Recently, I needed to write a [statement of purpose][wiki] oriented towards
teaching. I was applying to UA's [Graduate Certificate in College Teaching
program][cert]. Here is the [full statement][pdf] as I submitted it as PDF.

In this post, I want to talk about what I wrote about and why. Below is the
full text of the statement. Then, I'll try to sum up what I did into a few
tips and break down the process I went through writing this.

### My statement

Below is my teaching-oriented statement of purpose in full.

> "Chris, if you're hungry, just come by my office after class -- I have peanut
> butter and jelly sandwiches I could share with you." -- Dr. Muse

I declined, even though I hadn't eaten in two days. I was having financial
trouble, was considering dropping out, and came into class distraught. The
entire notion of sharing his lunch with me took me by surprise -- I had never
encountered a teacher that would do that sort of thing before. Dr. Muse taught
the Calculus 2 summer course I took after my first year at the University of
North Alabama. And to be honest, I'm not sure how I would have made it past the
first year without the faculty in the Mathematics & Computer Science
department. I'm certain I wouldn't have graduated.

I learned early on that I had an affinity for teaching. It began during
a course on assembly language in the last semester of my sophomore year.
Everyone in the course was nervous about the upcoming test, so I organized
a study group. I discovered that I was the only one in the group that had
a firm grasp on the study material, and I ended up playing teacher. Afterwards,
we met up to study in all our remaining courses. Being in that sort of learning
environment was fun and engaging. I ended up becoming a student tutor in
computer science for the University's Academic Resource Center for all levels
of courses.

Eventually, I made it to graduate school at the University of Alabama. Here, I
got to teach a real, live, actual course, which was an amazing experience. I
had fun doing everything from coming up with lecture material and all the way
down to the grading and holding office hours. There's something great about
watching and being part of a student transforming from not having confidence in
their skill to having such mastery that they begin helping their peers
understand material.

While I helped transform some students, I also know there are students that I
could not reach. I want to have a career in teaching at the college level and I
do not feel like these teaching experiences are enough. Hence, I am applying to
the program to get a Graduate Certificate in College Teaching. I believe a firm
grasp of theory, research, and practice related to teaching and learning in
higher education would help me get there. Thus far, my educational background
has solely been in computer science. Adding a grounding in education would not
only help me personally, but more importantly enable me to guide future
students towards success in their own lives and careers.

Most recently, I volunteered my summer at the Tuscaloosa Public Library for
their "Teen Zone: Tech Lab" program. The program is an outreach program that
gives any teen the chance to come by and play with technology they otherwise
wouldn't have access to, such as 3-D printing. I helped kids of all ages learn
to program and troubleshoot computers. One thing that struck me is that there
are a lot of brilliant children regularly participating, but did not believe
that they could make it to college. I thought, "man, this was *so* me," having
been through the same struggles when I was their age.

Although I am targeting collegiate teaching, I still have a desire for this
sort of outreach. I know that many people in this world need someone that will
help them realize their full potential. I would not be here if it weren't for
the professors, teachers, and colleagues I've had the privilege to learn from.
I am pursuing a teaching career, and I have peanut butter and jelly sandwiches
to share.

### Breakdown and Breakout

1. Do not be boring, be sappy

    The number one thing about a statement, for me, is to *not* be boring. Yes,
    I too, like *everyone else* in computer science, have loved to computer
    since birth. That's boring as heck. Why are you here? What is your story?
    Think of this essay more of as a "Story of Purpose" than a "Statement of
    Purpose". Breakout of your shell and write for yourself.

    When I begin writing a statement, I look for something funny, compelling,
    life-changing, &c that I did or happened to me. It needs to be a moment in
    time of something you think back upon often. It needs to be *sappy*. Don't
    worry about coming off as a lame-o, *you are a lame-o*. You're (probably)
    applying to graduate school, and you're going to be surrounded by other
    nerds just like yourself.

    Here, I chose the time Dr. Muse wanted to share his lunch with me. It's not
    exactly positioning me to appear as the greatest instructor in the world,
    but it instead lets the reader know that *I know and look up to some of the
    greatest instructors in the world.*

2. Be real about your past

    Seriously, don't bullshit. You need to pick out some actual examples of
    what has lead to where you are today. You weren't always a natural at this.
    Maybe your parents made you take piano lessons, but you hated it because
    you wanted to be doing computer stuff instead. Tell that story. What got
    you *started* in what you want to do?

    Again, this can be as sappy as you want. You don't have to have a story
    about landing the first space-snail on the moon, so don't worry if it
    doesn't seem "important." If it feels important to you, it's important!
    Just say so, and back it up with your realness.

    I chose the time I organized a study group. Not too thrilling, but it
    follows the flow of me being an undergrad early on in my studies. It
    sparked an interest in tutoring for me, which is simply one of the things
    you might need to do with students some day. It answers "what got me
    started?"

    Next, I chose my (brief) experiences of being in front of a real
    classroom. In this section, I address part of the "why am I here?" but also
    is a great bridge into "where I want to be."

3. Why does any of that matter

    So, why does writing any of the above matter? Well, it has everything to do
    with where you want to be. Where do you want to be? Why are you applying
    for the thing you have to write for? What is your reasoning for entering
    program X at school Y? What will this allow you to accomplish in the
    future?

    Here, I straight-up just say what I want to do. Nothing fancy. I also
    outline why it would benefit me, but more importantly, what the broader
    impacts of my studies might be. This is the most important part of the
    body, I think.

4. Your broad impact

    One of the last things you should cover is the potential broad impact you
    will achieve once this is all over.

    Here, I chose another story. I like stories. Stories are good.

5. Tie it together

    Conclude. You've done this before. Tie in the previous paragraph and then
    begin stating each of the previous paragraphs you wrote in reverse. That'll
    force you to summarize what you've described to the reader, and gives you
    potential for a great ender, especially if you followed my advice and chose
    something sappy for the opener.
